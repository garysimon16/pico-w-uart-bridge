Raspberry Pi Pico USB-UART Bridge
=================================

This program bridges the Raspberry Pi Pico HW UARTs to two independent USB CDC serial devices in order to behave like any other USB-to-UART Bridge controllers.

Raspberry Pi Pico Pinout
------------------------

| Raspberry Pi Pico GPIO | Function |
|:----------------------:|:--------:|
| GPIO16 (Pin 21)        | UART0 TX |
| GPIO17 (Pin 22)        | UART0 RX |
| GPIO4 (Pin 6)          | UART1 TX |
| GPIO5 (Pin 7)          | UART1 RX |

## Changes made for Pico-W

Added LED indication of UART write transfers. Amended LED to use the WiFi driver.

LED comes on for USB connection, goes off for disconnect. For UART writes, LED toggles momentarily.

### To build

```
git clone [path]
mkdir build
./build.sh
```

### To test

Connect the TX and RX either of the same UART or two separate.

Either use echo and cat:

```
stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 [baudrate] # make sure same rate set on both
cat /dev/ttyACM1
echo "Hello" > /dev/ttyACM0
```
It might take two echo tries for print to appear.

Or use minicom with the provided configs.Ë›
